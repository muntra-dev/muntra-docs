This repo uses GitHub Pages, which is a static site hosting service that takes the content of this repository and publishes it to [Muntra's documentation website](https://muntra-dev.github.io/muntra-docs/). The branch `gh-pages` is used to host the website.

### Deployment

Just run the following command to deploy to `gh-pages` and the public Github pages website.

```
yarn deploy
```

It can take up to 10 minutes for changes to publish after you push the changes to GitHub.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
